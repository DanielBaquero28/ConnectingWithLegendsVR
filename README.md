# Connecting With Legends VR

## 🏛️ About the Project

**Connecting With Legends VR** is an immersive virtual reality experience designed to revolutionize the way students learn history. This MVP leverages VR and AI to provide an interactive and engaging way to connect with historical figures, making education more dynamic, memorable, and impactful.

### 🎓 The Problem

Traditional history education often relies on passive learning through textbooks and lectures, which can lead to low engagement and retention. **Connecting With Legends VR** transforms history learning into an active, immersive experience that allows students to interact with historical figures as if they were truly there.

### 🕰️ How It Works

- 🌍 The user enters a **virtual auditorium** where they are greeted by a large interactive display.
- 🎭 They select from a **list of three historical figures** to engage with.
- 🗣️ They can **ask questions via text or voice**, and the AI-driven historical figure responds in real-time with:
  - A **realistic, AI-generated answer** based on historical facts.
  - **Voice synthesis output** to make the interaction more engaging.
  - **Text-based responses** displayed for accessibility.

## 🚀 Key Features

✅ **AI-Powered Conversations** – Engage with historical figures as if they were real, powered by natural language processing (NLP) and AI.\
✅ **Immersive VR Environment** – Experience history inside a fully interactive 3D auditorium.

✅ **Hand-Tracking Support** – Offers natural hand gestures for UI interaction.\
✅ **Multi-Modal Interaction** – Choose to communicate via **text or voice**, making the learning experience more accessible and personalized.\
✅ **Real-Time AI Responses** – Get immediate, historically accurate answers with text and audio feedback.\
✅ **Enhanced Learning & Retention** – Experience history rather than just reading about it, leveraging VR’s ability to **stimulate multiple senses** for improved memory and retention.

## 🎯 Why VR is the Future of Education

**Virtual Reality (VR) enhances learning by:**

- 🧠 **Stimulating multiple senses** – VR engages sight, sound, and interaction, improving memory encoding.
- 🎮 **Increasing engagement** – Interactive environments make education more captivating and enjoyable.
- ✋ **Encouraging active participation** – Users learn by doing, which strengthens understanding and retention.
- 📚 **Providing experiential learning** – Instead of memorizing facts, students experience history firsthand.
- 🏥 **Building practical skills** – VR is already used in medical training, engineering simulations, and more.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Unity** – Game engine powering the VR experience.
- **OpenXR** – Ensuring cross-platform compatibility.
- **Meta All-in-One SDK** – Enabling VR interactions on Meta Quest devices.
- **OpenAI API** – AI-driven conversational responses.
- **C#** – Core programming language for game logic.
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) & Azure AI Speech (Speech-to-Text & Text-to-Speech APIs)** – Enabling voice interactions.

## 📌 Future Enhancements (Beyond MVP Scope)

🔹 **Expanding Historical Figure Library** – Adding more characters and customizable knowledge bases.\
🔹 **Lifelike Facial Animations** – Improving immersion with realistic expressions and lip-syncing.\
🔹 **Multiplayer Classroom Mode** – Allowing teachers and students to engage together in a shared VR space.
